# AI Code Assistant Rules

## Core Principles
C1. Analyze issues systematically with root cause analysis
C2. Propose clear solutions with explanations
C3. Follow language-specific best practices and patterns
C4. Maintain clean code (no deprecated code, unused imports, proper docstrings)
C5. Document all significant changes
C6. Validate changes against existing tests and linting rules
C7. Preserve existing identifiers and comments to maintain context

## Response Format
Every response must follow this structure:

1. Analysis Phase
   - Identify affected components and files
   - List applicable rules from each relevant section
   - Document potential impacts and dependencies

   Example:
   ```
   üìÅ Affected Components:
   - backend/app/api/endpoints/projects.py
   - backend/app/services/project_service.py

   üìã Applicable Rules:
   Primary Rules:
   ‚úì S1: Authentication flows (Security)
   ‚úì E9: HTTP status codes (Error Handling)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è RC1: Rule conflict detected

   Supporting Rules:
   ‚ÑπÔ∏è B1: FastAPI patterns
   ‚ÑπÔ∏è D1: SQLAlchemy patterns
   ‚ÑπÔ∏è P2: Code preservation
   ```

2. Solution Design
   - Propose specific changes with rationale
   - Reference relevant rules for each change
   - Include code snippets with file paths

   Example:
   ```
   üí° Proposed Changes:
   1. ‚ú® Update error handling (E9, S1)
   2. üîí Improve auth flow (S1, S3)
   3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Preserve debug code (P1)

   ‚ùì Clarification needed:
   - Confirm if debug logging should be kept (P1 vs Q1)
   ```

3. Implementation Details
   - Provide code changes with file paths
   - Include comments referencing rules
   - Document any assumptions

   Example:
   ```python:backend/app/api/endpoints/projects.py
   @router.get("/{project_id}")  # ‚úì A1: RESTful convention
   async def get_project(
       project_id: int,
       current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)  # ‚úì S1: Auth flow
   ):
       try:
           # ‚úì E1: Error handling
           project = await project_service.get_project(project_id)
       except ProjectNotFound as e:
           # ‚úì E3: Error context
           logger.error("Project %s not found", project_id, exc_info=e)
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Project not found")
   ```

## Code Preservation Guidelines
P1. Preserve existing code comments and documentation
    - Keep decision comments explaining "why" something was done
    - Maintain TODO comments for future work
    - Preserve debugging helpers and tools
P2. Avoid premature optimization
    - Don't remove code that might serve a future purpose
    - Keep backward compatibility layers unless explicitly requested
    - Maintain diagnostic and debugging capabilities
P3. Document preservation decisions
    - Note why certain "unused" code was kept
    - Reference related issues or future requirements
    - Mark intentionally preserved code sections
P4. Handle technical debt carefully
    - Don't remove workarounds without understanding their purpose
    - Document known technical debt
    - Keep fallback implementations until new solutions are proven
P5. Preserve test support code
    - Keep test utilities even if currently unused
    - Maintain debugging helpers in tests
    - Preserve test data generators

## Rule Conflict Resolution
RC1. Identify conflicting rules
    - List all rules that conflict with the current request
    - Explain the nature of each conflict
    - Document potential impacts
RC2. Conflict resolution priority
    1. Security rules (S1-S8) always take precedence
    2. Data integrity rules (D1-D8) come second
    3. Error handling rules (E1-E10) are third
    4. Other rules follow based on context
RC3. Document override decisions
    - Note which rule was overridden and why
    - Document the temporary nature of overrides
    - Reference the authorizing prompt
RC4. Example conflict report format:
    ```
    Rule Conflict Detected:
    - Conflicting Rules: Q1 (Remove unused code) vs P2 (Avoid premature optimization)
    - Context: Unused but documented fallback implementation
    - Recommendation: Keep code (P2 takes precedence)
    - Rationale: Code serves as documented fallback mechanism
    - Override Required: No
    ```
